                One of my hobbies is learning new things, whether it be
                a new computer science algorithm, sports, physics, etc.
                I would describe myself to be an avid lifelong learner.

            </a>

            <p>
                One of my other hobbies is playing chess. I typically like 
                playing the time formats of ultrabullet and classical. I also 
                like playing variants of chess such as atomic chess and
                three-check chess. Fun fact, I am 1650+ rated in ultrabullet
                and 1750+ rated in classical on Lichess.

                One of my other hobbies is playing basketball. I enjoy
                playing basketball with my friends and family, as well
                as improving my general basketball skills in the process.
